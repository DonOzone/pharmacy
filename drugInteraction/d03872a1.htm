Sensitivity may last for 90 days or more. Exposure to normal indoor light is good, as this helps the body to eliminate porfimer. Therefore, do not stay in darkened rooms. Before exposing any area of skin to direct sunlight or bright indoor light, test for sensitivity by exposing a small area of skin to sunlight for 10 minutes. If there is no reaction (such as redness, blistering or swelling) within 24 hours, you can gradually increase your sun exposure time. If a reaction does occur, wait another 2 weeks before testing again. Do not use the face or skin around the eyes as a test area. If you travel to a place that has more sunlight, you should retest with the 10 minute exposure procedure. Sun screens will not prevent a reaction. Sun screens stop UV (invisible) light, while porfimer makes the skin sensitive to visible light</td></tr></table>
