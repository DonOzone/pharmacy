<td class="para"><b>Do not</b> take misoprostol for the prevention of stomach ulcers if you are pregnant or if you might become pregnant during treatment. If you do become pregnant during treatment with misoprostol, stop taking the medication and contact your doctor immediately. Misoprostol is in the FDA pregnancy category X. This means that misoprostol is known to be harmful to an unborn baby. Misoprostol can cause miscarriage or spontaneous abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. Misoprostol has also been reported to cause uterine rupture (tearing) when given after the eighth week of pregnancy, which can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. A pregnancy test with negative results will be required within 2 weeks of starting treatment with misoprostol, and treatment will begin only on the second or third day of a regular menstrual cycle. Also, appropriate contraception will be needed to prevent pregnancy during treatment and for one menstrual cycle following treatment. In some cases, misoprostol may be used under the supervision of a doctor for the induction of labor and delivery or abortion.</td></tr></table>
