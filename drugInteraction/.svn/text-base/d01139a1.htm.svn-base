<td class="para">RHo (D) immune globulin is a sterilized solution made from human blood. Rh is a substance that most people have in their blood (Rh positive) but some people don't (Rh negative). A person who is Rh negative can be exposed to Rh positive blood through a mismatched blood transfusion or during pregnancy when the baby has the opposite blood type.  When this exposure happens, the Rh negative blood will respond by making antibodies that will try to destroy the Rh positive blood cells.  This can cause medical problems such as anemia (loss of red blood cells), kidney failure, or shock.</td></tr></table>
