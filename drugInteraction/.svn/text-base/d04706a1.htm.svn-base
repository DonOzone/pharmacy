<td class="para">Cetrorelix blocks the effects of the naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing  hormone (GnRH). GnRH controls the release of another hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), which induces ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary) during the menstrual cycle. During hormone treatment for ovarian stimulation, premature ovulation may lead to eggs that are not suitable for fertilization. Cetrorelix blocks this undesirable premature ovulation.</td></tr></table>
