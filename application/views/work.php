          At age 55, Ray had sailed to his fourth promotion -- senior account manager for an office equipment company -- and was being eyed for an even higher level job, when he began to get vicious headaches. Although he denied he was struggling on the job, Ray was experiencing enough stress for his doctor to advise him to exercise and get some counseling. Ray did neither. As a result, he had such severe anxiety attacks on the way to work or when he even thought about his job that eventually he was unable to return to work -- anywhere. Ray's morale and self-esteem are described in an insurance company report as &quot;rock bottom.&quot;</p>
          <p>Joyce, a 44-year-old molding machine operator on an assembly line who was featured in the same report, had symptoms similar to Ray's. The intense light on the shop floor bothered her eyes, and the pressures of the assembly line left her exhausted. Her doctor diagnosed her as suffering from depression and advised her to take a leave.</p>
          <p>Unlike Ray, Joyce and her employer dealt directly with her burnout. Her employer supported her time off and asked her to pick a less stressful job. After 13 months on disability leave, she chose to return to work as a janitor. It was less taxing to her physically and mentally, and she worked her shift without anyone looking over her shoulder. Instead of flaming out, she was happy in her work again.</p>
          <p>One in three</p>
          <p>Both Ray's and Joyce's stories are examples of burnout from a survey of 600 workers published by Northwestern National Life Insurance Corp. -- now known as Reliastar. Among the report's findings: One in three people surveyed expected to burn out on the job in the near future.</p>
          <p>Burnout is ubiquitous</p>
          <p>The American Institute of Stress defines burnout as &quot;a disabling reaction to stress on the job.&quot; Aside from being painful for employees, burnout is expensive for the nation, according to the institute. It estimates that job stress costs U.S. industry $300 billion annually, as measured by absenteeism, decreased productivity, employee turnover, and direct medical, legal, and insurance fees. The institute also reports that nearly half of all American workers suffer from symptoms of burnout.</p>
          <p>Many of those symptoms are easy to spot. Burnout quickly erodes employees' physical and mental health, often resulting in fatigue, irritability, crying jags, and anxiety attacks. Other noticeable symptoms are loss of appetite or weight gain due to lack of exercise or overeating in reaction to stress. Subtler signs can include teeth grinding or increased drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, along with insomnia or nightmares, forgetfulness, low productivity, and an inability to concentrate.</p>
          <p>Left unattended, experts say, stress and burnout can lead to headaches, feelings of emptiness, cynicism, or a sense of isolation; lack of intimacy and lowered sex drive, and -- of course -- increased absenteeism.</p>
          <p>But overwork alone doesn't explain why some employees reach their breaking point when carrying a too-heavy load, while others carry on and even appear to thrive. The insurance company study found that workers who had little control and too many constraints on how to do the job were at a high risk of burnout -- a finding that may come as no surprise to frazzled clerical or assembly line employees. A substantial cut in employee benefits and frequent, mandatory overtime also upped the risk of burnout, as did layoffs, a merger or change of ownership, or other cutbacks. The reasons for job burnout, the researchers concluded, are varied and complex. In fact, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has its own take on what stresses workers to the point of no return. Along with workloads, infrequent breaks and long hours, NIOSH cites a lack of control over your job -- including little or no support from bosses and co-workers and an inability to participate in decision-making. Other factors contributing to stress and burnout may be familiar to many workers: They include job insecurity, too much responsibility or conflicting expectations, and unpleasant or dangerous conditions, such as crowding, noise, or ergonomic problems.</p>
