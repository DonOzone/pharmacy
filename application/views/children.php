          <p>Causes, incidence, and risk factors</p>
          <p>Physical abuse tends to occur at moments of great stress. Many people who commit physical abuse were abused themselves as children. As a result, they often do not realize that abuse is not appropriate discipline.</p>
          <p>Often people who commit physical abuse also have poor impulse control. This prevents them from thinking about what happens as a result of their actions.</p>
          <p>The rate of child abuse is fairly high. The most common form is neglect.</p>
          <p>The major risk factors for child abuse include:</p>

            Lack of education<br />
            Poverty<br />
