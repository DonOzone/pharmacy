            <p>Our team of pharmacists serves as patient advocates every day, bridging the gap between patients and physicians. Ultimately, we believe that successful treatment requires a complete understanding of medications and their implications for overall health. This forum is designed to provide guidance related to pharmacy services and prescribed treatment options. Let our pharmacists help you achieve better health.</p>
            <p>Click here to send us your question and one of our licensed pharmacists will respond to you as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>Can I use my health insurance card at Pharmaca?<br />
              Yes. Our pharmacy accepts most insurance—including Blue Cross, Aetna, Caremark and almost all others—so you only pay what is required by your plan. See partial list of insurance plans accepted at Pharmaca.</p>
            <p>Does Pharmaca dispense generic drugs to help me save money?<br />
              Yes. As you may know, generic drugs contain the same active ingredients as their brand name counterparts. They also have to meet regulatory requirements much like brand name drugs, including approval by the FDA. The generic version may simply have a different color or shape than you are used to seeing, but it will have the same effect. Pharmaca carries generic drugs. In most cases, these are less expensive than their branded counterparts. Be sure to ask your Pharmaca pharmacist about generics.</p>
            <p>Our customers can request to have their prescriptions filled with the brand formulation of their prescription. A prescriber may also specify a brand name drug on the script, but otherwise we will dispense the generic version.</p>
            <p>Does Pharmaca fill regular prescriptions written by my doctor?<br />
              Absolutely. Pharmaca is a full service pharmacy. While we offer some additional services that other big box stores might not, we still have your basic prescription needs covered.</p>
            <p>How do I transfer a recurring prescription from the pharmacy I use now?<br />
              It’s as easy as 1-2-3!</p>
            <p>Step 1: Call us or bring in your prescription bottle from another pharmacy.<br />
              Step 2: Have your insurance card handy.<br />
              Step 3: Pick up your filled prescription and enjoy $30 in free retail shopping! (Good toward non-pharmacy purchases only.)</p>
            <p>*See a pharmacist for details. Please note that in order to receive the coupon, the prescription you are transferring must not have been filled previously at any Pharmaca location. Learn more about the benefits of transferring your prescription.</p>
            <p>Is compounding right for me?<br />
              With your doctor’s approval, our compounding pharmacists can customize a medication if you are allergic to preservatives or dyes, require a non-manufactured strength or would like a different form or flavor. It may even be right for your child or pet. See more information about prescription compounding.</p>
            <p>What is an integrative pharmacy?<br />
              Whether you need fish oil, facial care products, flu remedies or floss, our integrative model offers a full-service pharmacy and complementary treatment options together under one roof.</p>
            <p>What is drug-induced nutrient depletion?<br />
              Some helpful prescription medications can interfere with your body’s ability to absorb important nutrients. This includes many commonly prescribed drugs including statins, oral contraceptives and others.</p>
            <p>Pharmaca wants to keep you informed about potential depletions and help you take preventive action. When you pick up your prescriptions, a Pharmaca pharmacist will let you know if your medications could cause depletions of vital nutrients. In many cases, your pharmacist will also provide a free sample of the supplements you need and a coupon for $2 off that Pharmaca brand supplement.</p>
            <p>Is my prescription ready to be picked up?<br />
              We always recommend calling before you come to pick up a prescription to ensure that it is ready. All of our store phone numbers are listed here.</p>
            <p>Can I obtain a copy of my prescription history?<br />
              Sure. Please contact your pharmacist so they can print out your profile and have it ready for you when you come to pick it up.</p>
